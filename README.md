# House-Price-modeling_Dissertation
Introduction   
The dissertation proposes three models by using deep learning method(Convolutional Neural Nework) to predict the housing price inb the region of California, US. The dataset contains the two features which are Numerical data, and images corresponding to housing prices. The aim of this dissertation is to compare three models which perform better in predicting the housing price based on different dataset. 
# Modeling Strategies   
## Numerical data input prediction model
The dataset contains numerical data, which gains from an open source Kaggle. The numerical data is in csv format contains 7 columns and over 15000 rows, which are the information about the house, address, number of beds, number of baths and so on. 

## Image input prediction model   
This dataset includes images of 15475 houses, and each image corresponding a housing price in the CSV file.

## Hybrid prediction model
The dataset contains the combination of numerical data and image input. Hybrid prediction model aims to perform a feature fusion of numerical input and image input by using CNN method.
