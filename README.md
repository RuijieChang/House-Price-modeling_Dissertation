# House-Price-modeling_Dissertation
## Introduction   
House is a need and the primary source of wealth for most of the Families. This research focus on the prediction of housing price by images and numerical data for the California, US. A great amount of factors will have influences on housing price, and mutilple factors are taking into account in this dissertation.  
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) method is applied to predict the housing price. Three models as listed above are based on the CNN method with Numerical data, image recongnition, and a hybrid model with feature fusion. 
## Research Object
Our research goal is to compare three models' performances of predicting the housing price. 
# Data Description 
The dataset was obtained from the open-source website Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ted8080/house-prices-and-images-socal), and it consists of both picture data and numerical data. The numerical data contains 7 conlunms adn over 15000rows, and the image data are from scraped exterior front images.   
  
Columns of the numerical data:
1.	image_id: the id of the image corresponds the houses.
2.	street: the street address of the house.
3.	citi: the city where the house is located.
4.	n_citi: the label encodes of the city column.
5.	bed: numbers of beds.
6.	bath: numbers of baths.
7.	sqft: square feet of the houses.
